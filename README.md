# Regression Analysis Project

This project performs regression analysis on the JTRAIN dataset from 'Introductory Econometrics' by Jeffrey Wooldridge. The analysis includes data preparation, regression modeling, multicollinearity check, heteroscedasticity test, autocorrelation test, and regression diagnostics plots.

## Project Structure

- `data`: Contains the dataset file `jtrain.csv`.
- `output`: Contains output files generated by the analysis, including summary statistics, correlation matrix, regression results, VIF, diagnostic test results, and plots.
  - `plots`: Contains the regression diagnostic plots.
- `scripts`: Contains the Python scripts for data preparation and regression analysis.
  - `data_preparation.py`: Script for loading and preparing the data.
  - `regression_analysis.py`: Script for performing regression analysis and generating plots.
- `main.py`: The main script that executes the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required for the project.

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Output

The analysis generates the following output files in the `output` directory:

- `summary_statistics.csv`: Summary statistics of the dataset.
- `correlation_matrix.csv`: Correlation matrix of the dataset.
- `regression_summary.txt`: Detailed regression results.
- `vif.csv`: Variance Inflation Factors for multicollinearity check.
- `breusch_pagan_test.txt`: Results of the Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity.
- `durbin_watson_test.txt`: Results of the Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation.
- `report_card.txt`: A comprehensive report summarizing the analysis and results.

The regression diagnostics plots are saved in the `output/plots` directory:

- `residuals_vs_fitted.png`
- `qq_plot_residuals.png`
- `scale_location_plot.png`
- `cooks_distance_plot.png`
- `leverage_residuals_squared_plot.png`

## Goal

The goal of this analysis is to understand the relationship between the average salary (`avgsal`) and other variables such as total employees trained (`totrain`), grants received (`grant`), number of employees (`employ`), sales (`sales`), union status (`union`), and year (`year`). The analysis involves checking for multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation in the regression model, and providing diagnostic plots to assess model assumptions.

## Methods

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Regression Modeling**: Fitting an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model.
3. **Multicollinearity Check**: Calculating Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) for the predictors.
4. **Heteroscedasticity Test**: Conducting the Breusch-Pagan test.
5. **Autocorrelation Test**: Conducting the Durbin-Watson test.
6. **Regression Diagnostics**: Generating plots for residuals, Q-Q plot, scale-location, Cook's distance, and leverage-residual squared.
